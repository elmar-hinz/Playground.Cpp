GCSD -dynamic, -dynamiclib, -dylib
##################################

-dynamic is a flag that both gcc and ld accept. gcc just passes it straight on to ld. It tells ld to build a dyanmically linked executable, as opposed to a statically linked one. It's turned on by default -- in fact, I don't think there's any official support for static executables on Darwin.

-dynamiclib is a gcc flag.  It tells gcc to pass -dylib to ld.


-dylib is an ld flag.  It tells ld to build a Mach-O dynamic shared library.


In other words, you should never have to use -dynamic. If you're building a dylib and using gcc to link (i.e. you're passing '-o lib<my_library>.dylib' to gcc), you'll use -dynamiclib. If you're building a dylib and using ld to link, you'll use -dylib.
